;;; keymap.lisp --- lisp subroutines for key binding detection

;;; keymaps are executed in priority from most specific to least
;;; that is, the order of execution for keymaps is:
;;; *global-map* --> major-mode-map --> minor-mode-maps
;;;
;;; keys are defined with the following syntax:
;;; (define-key *global-map* (key "C-x o") #'function-reference)
;;; in the previous example, the sequence of keys:
;;; "control+x", "o" would invoke the "function-reference"
